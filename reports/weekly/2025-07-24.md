## 📌 Notes

Biostatistics Research Project Plan:

1. Original BAM files from GDC
Still not sure which cancer data to use – there are 33 types of cancer data on GDC
I also want to try extracting BAM files myself in the lab – the technical requirements are high
At least 100–200 datasets are needed

2. Use GATK tools to generate VCF files
I’m currently learning how to use GATK and generate files

3. Use data from the VCF files to perform statistical analysis
I’m currently preparing to study AP Statistics and Python

4. Prepare and train a prediction model
Using Python

5. Validate the prediction model using GDC data
To see if my model can accurately predict cancer
